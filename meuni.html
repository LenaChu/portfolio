It is not just effective; even few minutes of meditation can improve resilience, it is also easy to learn. However, for people considering attending a meditation class, time and location are always two big challenges.</p><p>Many meditation apps have brought their solutions to address those challenges. While after surveying the main players in the market, we found there are still some shortcomings within the current solutions.

We listed the features they contain and compared the way they organize information. We also reviewed usersâ€™ comments and ratings. After those close examination, we were able to generalized some takeaways about what are provided and what are missed in the existing solutions.</p>

        <h3>PROBLEMS</h3>
        <p>Although we've seen many features provided by the competitors, there are still some gaps we think should be filled. When talking about the goal of forming a lasting habit, the most challenging thing for a meditation app is how to keep users using it. We found several problems might occur when the current solutions try to achieve this goal.</p>

Such behavior theories or models have attempted to explain how people form their health behaviors.</p><p>The theory and model gave us directions about how to trigger a behavior and how to keep the behavior. We found that motivation is the key factor for people to consider to change their health behaviors. While to from a long term health behavior, more factors come to play a role in the process, including self-efficacy, social support. Our solutions would focus on enhancing these three behavioral factors.</p></div>

            <div class="UIflow_pic">
                <p>Then we developed middle-fidelity wireframes. The system we chose is iOS. In order to fast generate the overall look of the interfaces, we adopted some elements from iOS Interface Guidelines, like the navigation bar and the tabbar. Here is a demonstration of the game section wireframes with UI flow indicators. The tool I used to draw the wireframes is Adobe XD.</p>

For design planning, we used brainstorming, task flows, and hand sketching interfaces to help us visualize the scope of our design. For UI design, I attempted several design tools including Adobe Illustrator, Adobe XD, and Figma, a collaborative design platform. I obtained expierences in designing a mobile product from ideating to implementing and team collaboration.</p><p>On the other hand, we also faced many challenges. For example, when we started addressing task flows, we found the scope of our design is bigger than we thought, and many details for interaction need to be considered. While it is challenging, it gave us reflections how important information architecture is. The game was also a tricky one. About game engagement, we discussed aspects about visual design and story telling. Those aspects may be the directions for our refining. Finally, it is pitiful that we didn't have time to validate our solutions by interview or usability test, and that's what I want to enhance in my next project.</p></div></div></section>
